c0mmit_b0t is a c program who is going to commmit a X number of commit as you want

to use it just: make re

then run ./c0mmit_b0t

The program will first check your number of commit

Then write your number of commit and the number of commit you want

Then just write your commit message (Info: You can't use whitespace so use _ instead like : a_big_car)

Have Fun!!!
